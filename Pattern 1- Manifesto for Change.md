# Pattern 1- Manifesto for Change

## Title

Manifesto for Change

## Patlet

A culture of local optimization and silo-thinking can impede the adoption of Innerource. This can be overcome by the creation of a formal document such as a manifesto, a community charter, or an Open-Source Contribution Policy.

## Problem

Organizational policies (KPI's and incentive structures) and processes create a culture of local optimization where mid-level managers and teams are disincentivized from information sharing and collaboration.

## Context

- Large organizations with multiple autonomous Business Units (BU's) lead to the formation of "_baronies_" in middle and lower management.
- The incentive and KPI measures in place do not consider InnerSource contributions by teams and this leads to silo-thinking, which in turn prevents widespread adoption of IS across organization.

## Forces

- The existence of multiple BU's complicates the creation of collaborative networks across an organization. The existence of multiple BU's led to decentralized software development and teams working towards their local goals.
- A key cause that hinders collaboration and sharing of code is a sense of "_Not invented here_" amongst teams.
- Lack of trust between teams over the maintenance of a shared software component which can be critical to one team while non-critical to another (P07).
- Middle managers (Technical owners and Project managers) face pressure to keep their teams happy while simultaneously meet deadlines (P04).
- Lack of awareness of costs associated with a bespoke solution such as licensing, onboarding, training, and maintaining can cause teams to favor local optimization (P10).
- Hours spent on development need to be booked with existing projects under different BU's. This leads to ambiguity around booking hours spent on IS projects (P11).

## Solution

The creation of a formal document such as: i) a manifesto (P14); ii) InnerSource principles based on the InnerSource manifesto from IS commons (P10); iii) a community charter (P07); iv) An Open Source Contribution Policy (P16); or v) InnerSource Maturity model (P10), will provide a sound theoretical basis to overcome silo-thinking.

This document should: a) Outline the goals; and b) Mandate strategies and incentives to promote IS. The Manifesto is the "_License to Contribute_" (P14). Prior to the manifesto creation groundwork is done to update rules, processes, finance requirements, time allocation, guidelines, and trainings (P11). This means that once the manifesto is adopted it is not simply a document but becomes a foundation for InnerSource. Another benefit is that the manifesto acts as an operational safety net for contributors working on projects outside their assigned area (P01).

## Resulting Context

- Making it a company-wide strategy will help to communicate and advocate InnerSource to developers and managers (P08).
- A manifesto can help to empower developers to use OS (P14).

**Limitation/Blockers**

- In organizations with multiple product lines, success can vary depending on type of application across products (P20).
- The creation and adoption of a manifesto needs many rounds of communication with enterprise level management (P08).
- This pattern cannot work in a standalone fashion and has to be implemented in conjunction with other patterns for efficacy (P01,P04,P07, P08,P11, P17,P23, and P25).

## Known Instances (optional)

This pattern has been identified by four (P10, P11, P20, P08) panelists to have been implemented in their organizations and has seen limited use in the case of three panelists (P01, P23, P07).
