# Pattern 12 â€“ Create a Single Source of Information

## Title

Create a single source of information 

## Patlet

A key challenge is the lack of discoverability of InnerSource projects in organizations. The discoverability of IS projects in an organisation can be enhanced by creating a single source of information which can include: a) A searchable catalogue of inner-source assets; b) An IS portal using software such as SAP; c) Adapting an existing portal and adding InnerSource labelled projects; and d) Embedding the portal into the IS on-boarding process.

## Problem

Lack of discoverability can hinder efforts by advocates to elicit greater contribution in InnerSource projects. Awareness of IS within the company is limited due to the absence of a single portal for InnerSource project information.

## Context

- Despite best efforts awareness about IS projects is limited within the company.
- Implementation of stop-gap solutions such as an IS catalogue does not resolve the problem of discoverability.

## Forces

- A false dichotomy exists between IS and assigning teams to work on code.
- Searching for IS projects on GitHub is not a feasible solution.

## Solutions

- Create a single source information such as a Wiki or an IS portal (P14), a searchable catalog of inner-source assets (P07, P19), or adapt an existing portal and add InnerSource labelled projects to it with the ability to filter with a dedicated InnerSource label (P17).
- Adopt a seeding strategy by implementing a software forge such as GitHub on an experimental basis (P10, P25). Once developers experience the utility of this, they will drive transition to the central software forge.

## Resulting Context

- Information sharing becomes convenient due to all documentation being in one place (P11).
- Enhances visibility and enables easy discovery of IS projects by contributors (P08, P17).

## Limitation/Blockers

- For desired effect this needs to be combined with a 12/18-month communications plan targeting leadership, developers, and all functional stakeholders (P25).
- The portals, Wikis should be visually attractive to engage prospective contributors (P11).
- Engineers need awareness that their responsibility does not end with putting code in a central repository and that they are serving other engineers (P01).
- The content of the portal needs to be curated and should have value added bits such as newsletters and key statistics (P17).
- Developers need to ingrain the habit of searching for code on the portal prior to writing code (P13).
- A portal can also suffer from a discoverability problem in larger organizations with many developer resources and tools (P04).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 9 panellists (P08, P11, P13, P14, P15, P17, P20, P23,and P25) to have been implemented in their organizations.
