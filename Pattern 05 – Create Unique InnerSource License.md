# Pattern 5 â€“ Create Unique InnerSource License

## Title

Create Unique InnerSource License

## Patlet

The legal ambiguity around Intellectual Property (IP) can prevent many business units from participating in InnerSource. The creation of customized internal InnerSource license with validation from the legal department and which accounts for diversity in intra-group trading rules can address issues related to distribution, use, and modification rights of shared source code.

## Problem

With organizations that are globally distributed, the sharing of source code across national boundaries raises questions of distribution, use, and modification rights. The legal ambiguity around IP ownership, code use rights, and patents can prevent many business units from participating in InnerSource.

## Context

- For organization's with multiple BU's, in the scenario of a BU being sold, valuable Intellectual Property (IP) can be lost in the absence of a licensing arrangement (P18).
- On the other hand, a very restrictive IS license which prohibits publishing of IS software as open source can discourage projects from adopting IS.

## Forces

- Without a license in place, sharing between BU's is inhibited by legal requirements.
- If projects find the license too restrictive, they will often stay with proprietary software and not opt for InnerSource (P07).

## Solutions

- A gatekeeping arrangement is adopted where the project registers on a company platform and enters an "_incubation phase_" where it is first checked for the IS license and compliance with export control regulations (P11).
- Involving legal teams or export control to create tailor made licenses for the individual cases (P03, P11, P18).
- The ISPO establishes an allow and deny list for the open-source licenses to be used in IS projects, as IS projects may cross companies' boundaries and country boundaries (P17).

## Resulting Context

- Senior management support will convince fence-sitters to take the leap (P03).
- License done with and publicly approved by the legal department is publicized on internal social network (e.g., Yammer). This results in greater participation by BU's as the IP rules are clearly defined.

## Limitation/Blockers

- There should be a clear distinction between IS and open-source SMEs, leaders, policies and processes and goals and objectives (P25).
- A proprietary IS license done by legal can be confusing to the engineers who are used to simpler Open Source licenses (P11).

## Known Instances

This pattern has been identified by four panelists (P11, P14, P17, and P23) to have been implemented in their organizations.
