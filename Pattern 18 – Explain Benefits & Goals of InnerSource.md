# Pattern 18 â€“ Explain Benefits & Goals of InnerSource

## Title

Explain benefits and goals of InnerSource 

## Patlet

Team culture can make it difficult to implement InnerSource and inculcate collaborative behaviours. This can be resolved by motivating teams to take-up IS it is important by explaining the tangible benefits of IS such as the ability to unblock, reduction in duplication of effort, development of team members, networking with colleagues, and collaborative learning. Additionally, the clear definition of goals along the lines of engineering efficiency, speed of innovation, and developer satisfaction can help in motivating people.

## Problem

Ingrained team culture is difficult to change and takes persistent effort to get the teams to collaborate with other teams and explore InnerSource. This culture also leads to an unwillingness to look holistically at a problem and identify issues on which the team can collaborate with other teams.

## Context

- People are comfortable with a certain pattern of working and this leads to a reluctance to take up InnerSource (P01, P04).
- While engineers are happy to adopt IS, middle management are reluctant to implement collaborative ways of working (P08, P18).
- The company funding structure disincentivizes sharing of code as teams funded based on software exclusive to them (P11).

## Forces

- Policies such as compliance and security affect collaborative initiatives such as IS (P04).

## Solutions

- focus on the tangible benefits for the team which include ability to unblock, reduction in duplication and repetition of effort, development of team members, networking with colleagues, and collaborative learning (P04, P14, P20, P23).
- Utilize venues such as company conferences can be used to broadcast the benefits of IS (P23).
- Managers take the initiative to educate team members on IS (P09).

## Resulting Context

- There is a positive increase in team productivity and in the consistency of IS as teams and managers understand the benefits of IS (P08, P09).
- Explaining the benefits makes IS more visible and encourages people to look through the documentation. Adoption of IS is the next logical step once people are convinced of the benefits (P04).

## Limitation/Blockers

- It is difficult to measure the tangible benefits of IS due to the long-term nature of InnerSource (P08, P17).
- There is a large communication overhead as a few self-motivated IS advocates will not be able to cover a large organization (P20).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 7 panellists (P04, P08, P09, P13, P17, P20, and P23) to have been implemented in their organizations.
