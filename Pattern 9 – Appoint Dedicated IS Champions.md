# Pattern 9 â€“ Appoint Dedicated IS Champions

## Title

Appoint dedicated IS champions 

## Patlet

InnerSource programs do not scale beyond grassroots initiatives due to a lack of motivated advocates. InnerSource can be promoted and sustained by dedicated champions or community managers who are responsible for promoting IS through the organization by different means such as blogging, talks, and conversations with teams.

## Problem

For an InnerSource program to be successful and to scale beyond small grassroots initiatives there is a need for a dedicated manager who has a collaborative mindset, good communication skills, skillful marketing, and can take a strategic overview.

## Context

- Organizational structures favor local optimization which leads to focus on team level priorities over multi-team collaboration (P01).
- Communication and promotion of InnerSource is a full-time role which cannot be performed by developers and engineers due to time constraints (P11). Part-time commitment results in reduced effectiveness due to conflicting priorities.
- Multiple existing grassroots initiatives need to be scaled-up for strategic benefits (P20).
- A broad communication strategy is needed which focuses on promoting a culture receptive to IS (P18).
- The lack of a cohesive communication plan in organizations can limit the visibility of InnerSource.

## Forces

- Local optimization can manifest in large organizations with multiple BU's due to diversity of IS initiatives and lack of coordination between them.
- Lack of IS experts who understand the need for inviting, facilitating, and mentoring contributions (P10, P20, P23).
- Lack of IS experts who have a sound understanding of OS and IS concepts (P10).
- Organizations suffer from an overload of information and simply adding more information on IS will not help (P04).

## Solutions

- Appointment of dedicated champions or community managers responsible for promoting IS through the organization by different means such as blogging, talks, conversations with teams etc. (P14, P17). The champions can be engineers who are part of the ISPO or a technical oversight board, who help with outreach and project reviews (P19).
- For large organizations a core team of champions representing the BU's needs to be constituted who passionate about IS and motivated by a desire to help it grow (P03, P07, P20, P25). The team can be organized as a steering committee with regular meetings and a clear mandate.
- The Champions have great social skills, good knowledge of compliance & regulatory issues, and are excellent communicators with the ability to motivate people (P11, P17).
- The Champions act as establishers of IS within the organization by mentoring teams, facilitating learning, encouraging retrospectives, bringing external knowledge into the organization (P10).

## Resulting Context

- If the champions are recruited from within the organization, they can influence policy and effectively advocate for IS (P03).
- Increased transparency around process and a support system is created for developers looking to make the best use of IS (P14).
- The champion acts as a knowledge exchange interchange between the BU's by spreading benefits and best practices of IS (P14).
- As the champion is known and well-networked, they will become a single point of contact for InnerSource questions (P09).

## Limitation/Blockers

- Appointment of a dedicated champion with enough seniority requires support from senior management (P03, P09, P18, P23).
- In a large organization, a team of champions will be needed to scale the initiative (P04).
- For the role to be effective it needs to be full-time, structured, distinct from developer roles, and the champion adequately trained in InnerSource (P03, P07, P09, P11).
- Senior management can lack understanding of the non-technical aspects of the champion role and there is no budgetary support for hiring and retention of appropriate personnel (P11).
- It is difficult to find a person with good IS and communication skills to fill the role and a replacement if the post falls vacant (P08, P13).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 15 panelists (P01, P03, P04, P07, P08, P09, P10, P11, P13, P14, P17, P18, P20, P23, and P25) to have been implemented in their organizations.
