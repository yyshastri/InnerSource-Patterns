# Pattern 13 â€“ Implement Community Building Program

## Title

Implement community building program 

## Patlet

Awareness of InnerSource is limited to few individuals within the organization and there is a lack of shared understanding of InnerSource principles in teams adopting InnerSource. Awareness and shared understanding of IS practices can be developed via communities of practice where developers across different silos collaborate.

## Problem

Awareness of the benefits and principles of InnerSource with limited to a few committed people in the engineering team. The intangible nature of InnerSource leads to varying interpretations and difficulty in ensuring consistency when scaling beyond one or two teams who are familiar with IS principles.

## Context

- Multiple existing grassroots initiatives need to be scaled-up for strategic benefits (P20).
- Awareness about IS benefits can remain limited if most stakeholders have traditional infrastructure backgrounds (P09, P18).
- Lack of awareness can lead people to make assumptions about IS which might not be true (P01).
- Multiple and sometimes wrong interpretations can be solidified in the form of corporate policy documents, leading to a lot of confusion, misconceptions, and unwarranted reservation towards InnerSource (P09).

## Forces

- InnerSource is often limited to people having a previous external experience in an Open-Source community (P17).
- If the InnerSource implementation is limited to projects that are deemed business priority, it can lead to teams starting up their own InnerSource initiative.
- People see it as a fashionable trend (for e.g. similar to Agile) and lack a deeper understanding of InnerSource (P01).

## Solutions

- The IS initiative can be implemented via communities of practice based upon the developer's specialization such as architects, engineers, API, Security/DevSecOps, Quality etc. This also helps in encouraging knowledge sharing and code reuse (P23).
- Existing frameworks such as the "Open Serious Community Framework" can be used to generate community engagement (P07).
- Community building can be done by establishing Internal community forums for engineers with weekly meetings to share projects, ideas, and questions (P01).
- Establish a formal training program using material from the InnerSource Commons and applying the IS maturity model to identify gaps in IS implementation (P10).

## Resulting Context

- Key benefits are increased communication (P03), more efficient work due to de-siloing (P08), greater discoverability (P08), and increased trust amongst people (P01).

## Limitation/Blockers

- Excessive segmentation by specialization can have unintended consequence of reinforcing silo effect (P25).
- The creation of a trust environment is only the first step towards meaningful code collaboration (P01).
- This strategy needs a strong leader that can overcome business boundary issues, include egos, encourages collaborators, and provides clarity (P04, P08).
- The communities can get side-tracked into the promotion of other initiatives to the detriment of IS (P03).
- Differing implementations and viewpoints enhance IS as it is a behaviour to be ingrained (P04).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 10 panelists (P01, P03, P04, P08,P10,P11,P13, P15, P17, and P23) to have been implemented in their organizations.
