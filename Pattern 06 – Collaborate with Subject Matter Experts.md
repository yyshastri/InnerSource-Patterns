# Pattern 6 â€“ Collaborate with Subject Matter Experts

## Title

Collaborate with Subject Matter Experts (SME's) 

## Patlet

The legal ambiguity around the sharing of source code across national boundaries can prevent business units from participating in InnerSource. Collaborating in InnerSource policy development with SMEs from departments such as tax, intellectual property, export control and legal, will help creation of appropriate Intellectual Property (IP) policies and meet compliance requirements.

## Problem

With organizations that are globally distributed, the sharing of source code across national boundaries raises questions of distribution, use, and modification rights. The legal ambiguity around IP ownership, regulatory compliance, code use rights, and patents can prevent many business units from participating in InnerSource.

## Context

- Software engineers do not have the expertise to draft appropriate Intellectual Property (IP) policies and understand compliance requirements.
- Collaboration in InnerSource projects is, to a large degree, cross-divisional and international (P09).
- In sectors with strong regulatory requirements, it is very important to integrate compliance in processes around InnerSource and Open Source (P14).

## Forces

- The InnerSource program can face objections from SME's if it does not meet legal and compliance requirements (P11).
- If business units find it difficult to ensure compliance across cross-divisional and multi-region projects, they can be tempted to limit collaboration between teams.
- If the maintenance team is working on software which is subject to stringent requirements around quality management and traceability, this might prevent contributions from other teams in the organization (P04, P23).

## Solutions

- Develop a compliance training for software developers where several of these challenges are explained in practical terms (P23).
- Collaborate with SME's to develop policies and reach consensus on compliance issues (P11, P17, P23).

## Resulting Context

- Collaboration leads to the creation of appropriate governance, legal and regulatory processes (P09, P11, P17).

## Limitation/Blockers

- It is difficult to find the right people from the legal and regulatory departments who are knowledgeable about InnerSource (P10, P18).
- Availability of SMEs can be limited due to other priorities (P23).
- Due to involvement of people from different backgrounds it can be difficult to reach a consensus on issues (P14).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by seven panelists (P04, P09, P10, P11, P14, P17, and P23) to have been implemented in their organizations.
