A big thank you for participating in Round 2 — we hope you will be able to complete Round 3, which is the final round and which we expect will take about 1-2 hours. Below we describe the focus of Round 3.

This document presents the synthesis of the results of Round 2 in which we asked you to provide your feedback on the challenges and strategies identified in Round 1. Based on your inputs we have distilled a list of InnerSource Patterns whose structure is based on the patterns as found in the InnerSource Commons.

In Round 2 you were presented with a hierarchy of levels, wherein each level had a set of associated challenges and strategies. A brief explanation of each level is given below.

- Level 1 Organizational Environment: An organization’s environment can be considered as an amalgamation of the organizational culture, its policies and processes, and the behavioral element of the units which make up the organization, i.e., business units, departments, and teams.

- Level 2 Executive Management: This is the second layer and is an element which exerts considerable influence on the behavior of other layers. Executive management is also able to influence the constituent factors of the organizational environment. 

- Level 3 Middle Management: Middle management is the third layer and has a certain amount of independent agency which allows it to influence the behavior of the team.

- Level 4 Team: The team is a dynamic unit composed of individuals who may be developers or a cross-functional team of testers, developers, architects. This is not a static unit and has a unique existence within the broader organization.

- Level 5 Individual: The individual is the innermost layer and comprises of people who constitute the team. 

***Focus for Round 3:*** The GitHub [repository](https://github.com/yyshastri/InnerSource-Patterns) contains a a list of 19 patterns which were identified during the analysis of your inputs from Round 2. 

Please match the patterns to the level which you think is appropriate. If you feel that a pattern overlaps into multiple levels, please feel free to match it with the relevant levels.

Please be sure to use the [Round 3 template](https://github.com/yyshastri/InnerSource-Patterns/blob/main/Round%203-template.docx) in the repository to match patterns to any of the 5 levels.
