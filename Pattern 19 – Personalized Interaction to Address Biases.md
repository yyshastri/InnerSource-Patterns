# Pattern 19 â€“ Personalized Interaction to Address Biases

## Title

Personalized interaction to address biases

## Patlet

Lack of awareness of InnerSource can lead people to make wrong assumptions about InnerSource. Presentations and one-on-one discussions can help dispel biases regarding IS. This is particularly important when engineers come from a traditional software development background and are ignorant of the IS workflow. One-to-one discussions can particularly help remove worries especially when engineers have experienced issues with organizational priorities on previous occasions.

## Problem

Ignorance of IS practices can lead people to have pre-conceived notions about IS. One assumption is the lack of a quality control process due to the diversity of contributors. Another effect is ambiguity in the responsibility of the maintaining team or ignorance of the iterative nature of pull requests.

## Context

- While there is support for Open-Source initiatives in the engineering community within the organization, there can be misconception that InnerSource may dilute the organizations commitment to Open Source.
- There is a lack of knowledge about tools such as GitHub and InnerSource practices.
- Ignorance about InnerSource practices led to a less smooth workflow in the initial stages of implementation.
- People are reluctant to contribute due to a perception that getting benefits from IS needs a lot of work of work.
- Lack of knowledge sharing leads to a poor understanding of IS which in turn results in poor quality pull requests (P18).
- Cursory knowledge also leads to people across all levels assuming that IS projects come with "no warranty" (P11).

## Forces

- Managers have implicit trust in the work of their teams, at the same time are reluctant to take code from other teams due to trust issues. This results in different levels of tolerance for quality from own team versus other teams (P01).
- For developers will less experience collaboration is a significant paradigm shift as they are used to incentives based on individual achievement (P04).

## Solutions

- Presentations and one-on-one discussions can help dispel biases regarding IS. This is particularly important when engineers come from a traditional software development background and are ignorant of the IS workflow (P11).
- The Product Owner takes accountability for sharing the vision and strategic direction for his product and explains this to people and ensures the documentation around it is easy to locate (P18).

## Resulting Context

- Explaining the benefits makes IS more visible and encourages people to look through the documentation. Adoption is the next logical step once people are convinced of the benefits (P04).
- One-to-one discussions can particularly help remove worries especially when engineers have experienced issues with organizational priorities on previous occasions (P15).
- The discussions help clarify doubts and help the IS advocates understand the different perspectives and backgrounds of people. The problems which surface during the discussions and the solutions can be used in similar discussions later (P11).

## Limitation/Blockers

- Awareness, acceptance and adoption can be slow to gain traction due to the magnitude of competing priorities and limited cognitive bandwidth (P15).
- It is difficult to scale one-to-one interaction in large organizations (P04, P09).
- It can be difficult to convince managers and engineers who are not from a software development and open source background (P09).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 7 panellists (P01, P01, P11, P15,P20, and P23) to have been implemented in their organizations.
