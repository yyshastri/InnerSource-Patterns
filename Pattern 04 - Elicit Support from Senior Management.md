# Pattern 4 - Elicit Support from Senior Management

## Title

Elicit support from senior management 

## Patlet

Organizational policies (KPI's and incentive structures) disincentivize people from contributing to InnerSource. Top management support can help overcome established organizational culture which promotes local optimization.

## Problem

Organizational policies (KPI's and incentive structures) and politics create a culture of local optimization where mid-level managers and teams are disincentivized from information sharing and collaboration.

## Context

- Large organization's with multiple autonomous Business Units (BU's) lead to the formation of "_baronies_" in middle and lower management.
- The incentive and KPI measures in place do not consider InnerSource contributions by teams and this leads to a silo-thinking which in turn prevents widespread adoption of IS across organization.

## Forces

- The existence of multiple BU's complicates creation of collaborative networks across organization.
- Another key cause that hinders collaboration and sharing of code is a sense of "_didn't build it here_" amongst teams.
- Lack of trust between teams over the maintenance of a shared solution which can be critical to one team while non-critical to another (P07).
- Middle managers (Technical owners and Project managers) face pressure to keep their teams happy while simultaneously meet deadlines (P04).
- Ignorance of costs associated with a bespoke solution such as licensing, onboarding, training, and maintaining can cause teams to favor local optimization (P10).
- Hours spent on development needed to be booked with existing projects under different BU's. This led to ambiguity around booking hours spent on IS projects (P11).

## Solutions

- Senior management declares IS to be the norm not the exception (P23).
- Senior management from the Vice-President level include IS in their presentations on company strategy (P17, P19).
- Strong messaging by COO & CTO's via emails and companywide events on the importance of InnerSource (P08).
- Allocating funds for a mutual collaborative environment (e.g., GitHub).
- Sponsorship by a change management committee such as a Digital Transformation Program (P07).
- Setting up a dedicated program which enables 10% of engineering time allocated to InnerSource (P15).
- Get senior management to greenlight the manifesto before publishing it. This is also a solution to Sample Pattern 1.

## Resulting Context

- Senior management support will convince fence-sitters to take the leap (P03).

## Limitation/Blockers

- Difficult to get senior managers at the COO and CTO level who recognize the value of InnerSource (P08).
- Without grassroots participation the top-down implementation will fail (P10).
- The size and type of organization can mean many software development initiatives competing for senior management attention (P23).
- In a hierarchical organization with multiple layers, InnerSource must be promoted by a committed and motivated person for senior management to take notice (P11).
- Absence of metrics to measure utilization of time allocated for InnerSource (P15).
- Difficulty in searching for code and aversion to sharing code can nullify senior management support (P01).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by six panelists (P01, P07, P08, P11,P15,and P17) to have been implemented in their organizations.
