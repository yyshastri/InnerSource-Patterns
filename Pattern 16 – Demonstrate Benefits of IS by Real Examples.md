# Pattern 16 â€“ Demonstrate Benefits of IS by Real Examples

## Title

Demonstrate benefits of IS by real examples 

## Patlet

A lack of knowledge about InnerSource can manifest in senior management not understanding the cultural transformation it entails. Senior management can be educated on the long-term nature and benefits of IS by demonstrating the productivity benefits by means of pilot projects. Achieving success in pilot IS projects can be a strong factor for senior management to scale-up IS. These success stories can be presented in a neutral fashion, at forums which involve senior management to bolster the case in a subtle manner.

## Problem

InnerSource is perceived to be a technical issue rather than a cultural one. This cause manifests as different symptoms including IS being adopted on a piecemeal basis in the company and senior management exhibiting a preference for ready-made solutions. Another related issue is the rise of scepticism due to the inability to measure IS benefits as it is a long-term process with several intangibles such as behavioral changes in employees.

## Context

- Established KPI's designed to measure quantitative performance data are inappropriate to measure InnerSource benefits. Senior management wants to understand the Return on Investment (ROI), which is difficult in the absence of tailored metrics.
- Senior management does not have an Open-Source background (P09).
- Senior management wants to kickstart IS at the technical level without understanding the long-term cultural transformation aspect (P25).
- Making IS the norm across the organization can result in shared code without the adoption of IS philosophy by the participating teams (P11).
- Future maintainability concerns and a low level of trust in IS projects leads to preference for third party products (P23).

## Forces

- In large organizations a considerable number of senior managers come from a non-software development background. This means they are not aware of methodologies such as InnerSource and see it more as a tool to fix technical problems(P09).

## Solutions

- In the initial phase rather than KPI's, focus is directed on measures which show the adoption of IS like the number of users, repositories, traffic, pull requests, breakdown per business unit (P23).
- Implementing pilot projects which are clearly defined within a SMART framework and align with the larger business objectives (P25). This raises the possibility of success and will help in sustaining the IS program (P08, P09). The successful projects can then be showcased as ideal case studies through the organisation and also give access to people that are practicing InnerSource and thus are seen as trusted advisors for their own InnerSource journey (P04).
- A regularly updated dashboard which displays IS project data and metrics on a daily basis (P17).
- Adopt KPI's from external knowledge sources which are relevant to IS such as change lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, knowledge transfer, and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (P10, P17, P23).

## Resulting Context

- Projects implementing InnerSource principles show better scores on measures such as change lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, knowledge transfer, and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (P17).
- The case studies of successful products or services using InnerSource are used to drive innovation and engineering efficiency (P04).
- The pilot projects provide a safe zone for teams to experiment (P13).
- Increased collaboration over time leads to less overhead for the maintaining team (P04).

## Limitation/Blockers

- It can be challenging to define business case and outcomes (P23).
- For IS to become a companywide phenomenon, there needs to be robust communication effort to proactively sharing the success stories (P20).
- To be relevant to a wider audience there needs to be a case study for each type of product or service (P04).
- Cognitive dissonance in people where they appreciate the success of the pilot projects but do not apply it to their project context (P03).

## Known Instances

- This pattern has been identified by 10 panellists (P04, P07, P08, P09, P11, P15, P17, P20, P23 and P25) to have been implemented in their organizations.
